# Anudip_project
This project analyzes air pollution data of major Indian cities over multiple years. Using Python and data visualization techniques, it provides insights into trends, peak pollutant levels, and city-wise comparisons, helping understand environmental patterns and support data-driven decision making.

 Air Pollution Analysis Project 

 
### **1. Project Objective**

* To analyze air pollution levels in major Indian cities across multiple years.
* To identify which city had the highest and lowest pollution in specific years.
* To visualize pollution trends using Python and Google Colab.

---

### **2. Dataset Preparation**

* Created a custom **CSV file** containing:

  * City names (Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, etc.)
  * Year-wise pollution values (e.g., 2015–2025)
  * Pollutants like **PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO** (as available)
* Ensured the data was clean, consistent, and ready for analysis.

---

### **3. Tools & Technologies Used**

* **Python** for data processing and visualization.
* **Google Colab** as the coding environment.
* **Pandas** for loading, cleaning, and manipulating the dataset.
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn** for generating graphs.
* **NumPy** for numeric operations (if used).
* **CSV** file format for clean structured data.

---

### **4. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

* Loaded the CSV into a DataFrame.
* Checked for missing values and corrected inconsistencies.
* Converted data types (e.g., year → integer).
* Organized the data city-wise and year-wise.

---

### **5. Visualizations Created**

* **Line graphs** showing pollution trend of each city from 2015 onward.
* **Bar charts** comparing cities for a specific year (e.g., 2015).
* **Graphs showing highest and lowest pollution** per year.
* **Multi-pollutant graph** for 2015 (all pollutants in one visualization).
* Optional: Heatmap to show pollution intensity across cities/years.

---

### **6. Key Analysis Performed**

* Found which city recorded the **highest pollution** in 2015.
* Found which city recorded the **lowest pollution** in that year.
* Compared how pollution levels changed over time.
* Identified cities with rapidly increasing or decreasing pollution.
* Created combined graphs to show multiple pollutants together.

---

### **7. Output Files Stored**

* **Code file** (.ipynb / .py)
* **CSV dataset**
* **Graphs** (PNG images) for:

  * Year-wise city comparison
  * Trend lines
  * Highest/lowest analysis
  * Combined pollutant visualization

---

### **8. GitHub Upload Structure**

* Code uploaded separately.
* Output images uploaded separately.
* CSV dataset uploaded for reuse.
* A short project description and commit messages included.

---

### **9. End Goal / Purpose of the Project**

* To provide a data-backed understanding of air pollution severity.
* To help users visually compare pollution across cities and years.
* To build an easy-to-understand analytical model for environmental studies.
* To practice Python, data analysis, and visualization techniques.

---

### **10. Applications of This Project**

* Useful for environmental monitoring studies.
* Can be extended with real-time API data.
* Can support ML models for pollution prediction (future scope).
* Useful in academic submissions, portfolios, and GitHub profiles.
